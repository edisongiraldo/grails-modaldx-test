=======================


[ModalDynamix](https://github.com/vahidhedayati/modaldynamix) is a Grails plugin which makes use of jquery, bootstrap and modalbox to load various types of forms  Self Posting,I Frame, Remote Forms and normal calls via ModalBox, upon trigger save or close depending on type of call, the underlying form is updated with new values without page refreshes.'
 
A common problem when it comes to forms within a website is having the ability to update preset values on the form without redirecting or opening up new tabs etc.
This plugin aims to help in the process of producing dynamic forms that sit on top of other forms that are then opened in a pop up modalbox and their 
actions update your underlying form without refreshing actual page.
